		<h1>Zone of Death (Yellowstone)</h1>

		<!-- my first paragraph! -->
		<p>The Zone of Death is the 50-square-mile (129.50 km2) part of Yellowstone National Park in the U.S. state of Idaho in which, as a result of a purported loophole in the Constitution of the United States, a person could theoretically avoid conviction for any major crime, up to and including murder.</p>

		<h2>Loophole</h2>

		<!-- the second paragraph-->
		<p>The United States District Court for the District of Wyoming is currently the only United States district court to have jurisdiction over parts of multiple states.<br>This is because its jurisdiction includes all of Yellowstone National Park, which extends slightly beyond Wyoming's boundaries into Idaho and Montana. In addition, the federal government has exclusive jurisdiction over the park, so crimes committed in the park cannot be prosecuted under any of the states' laws.</p>

		<h3>Discovery</h3>

		<!-- in the following paragraph I'm using a linebreak <br> tag to seperate each sentence -->
		<p>The constitutional loophole in this area was discovered by Michigan State University law professor Brian C. Kalt while he was planning to write an essay about technicalities of the Sixth Amendment, which entitles criminal defendants to a fair and quick trial.<br>Kalt wondered about a hypothetical place where there were not enough eligible citizens to form a jury and theorized that there could be no trial and therefore no punishment for major crimes in that area.<br>He later realized that there was such a place: the Idaho section of Yellowstone National Park.<br>Horrified by his realization, Kalt shifted his focus to writing an essay about the area to persuade the government to fix the loophole.<br>The essay, which is called "The Perfect Crime", was published in 2005 in The Georgetown Law Journal.</p>

		<h4>History</h4>

		<!-- my final paragraph no linebreaks here -->
		<p>After Kalt discovered the loophole, he worked to have Congress close it. He suggested to lawmakers in Wyoming that the Zone of Death be included as part of the federal district court for the District of Idaho instead of the Wyoming district, which would fix the issue. However, Congress ignored Kalt's suggestion. In 2007, author C. J. Box wrote a novel called Free Fire that featured the Zone, which Box hoped would increase governmental awareness. The novel did succeed in alerting Wyoming Senator Mike Enzi to the issue. However, Enzi was unable to convince Congress to discuss it.</p>
